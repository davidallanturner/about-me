# about-me
This is a page that will eventually develop into a portfolio page

# Current Itteration
This currently sits at version 1. It includes an alert and prompt quiz for the users of 5 questions and a page that has a brief rundown of my professional history.

# todo
I'm going to style the CSS.
I want to do a style with large background image, and strong text in front. 
I wish to include iconography from font-awesome or a similar library to give visual appeal to bullet points
I wish to create a roll over with only a 15% fade opacity add for the section's answers (later to be portfolio pieces)

# Shoutout
Shoutout goes to Jason for a quick proof read of my JS. Made some simple spelling errors and chose a prompt instead of an alert at one point. Whoops. Good looking out Jason!
